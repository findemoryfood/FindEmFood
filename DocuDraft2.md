**FindEmFood**

Find Em Food is a mobile app focused on connecting Emory students with food resources on campus. Utilizing the userâ€™s location, the app would connect hungry students with free food opportunities on campus around them, showing where these events are and how to get there. Information on free food opportunities would be user submitted from Emory-verified accounts, giving a space to connect event organizers (with excess food) and curious students.


**Technical Documentation for FindEmFood** 

**Overview**

App.js is the main component for a React application that uses **React Router** for navigation and **Context API** for managing application-wide settings. 

The GPS component is a comprehensive navigation tool integrated with Google Maps, designed to assist users in finding routes between campus buildings and locations. It supports outdoor and indoor maps, toggles between light and dark themes, and includes features for food event popups.

This module initializes and configures a Firebase application for use in a web app. It includes setup for Firebase Analytics and Firebase Realtime Database. The configuration uses the Firebase JavaScript SDK. It supports operations for writing, updating, deleting, and fetching data for food and user-related records.

This App also facilitates the automation of fetching messages from GroupMe, parsing them using OpenAI, and storing the structured data in Firebase Realtime Database. It includes utilities for message processing, AI-powered parsing, and database population.
