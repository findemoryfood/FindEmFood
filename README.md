# FindEmFood
Emory nutrition/food finder app

Find Em Food is a mobile app focused on connecting Emory students with food resources on campus. Utilizing the userâ€™s location, the app would connect hungry students with free food opportunities on campus around them, showing where these events are and how to get there. Information on free food opportunities would be user submitted from Emory-verified accounts, giving a space to connect event organizers (with excess food) and curious students.
